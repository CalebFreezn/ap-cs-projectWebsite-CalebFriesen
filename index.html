      <h2>Snap! Project</h2>
      <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html">Snap! link</a></p>
      <p>Making asterisks of different sizes on Snap! Make a block of code that forms an asterisk with an adjustable size and amount of branches. I learned how to make new blocks and how to use and adjust variables.

      <h2>Hotel Ratings</h2>
      <p><a href="https://learn.grasshopper.app/">Grosshopper (Java)</a></p>
      <p>Compiling hotel ratings using Javascript on Grasshopper.  The goal was to take the ratings of hotels in a certain area and display them in an array, so you can see which is the best one. I learned how to code for..of loops and arrays with JavaScript. It was challenging figuring out where to put the variables and where to put the functions and variables in the for..of loops.

      <p><a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup link</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.homestyler.com/">Homestyler link</a></p>
      <p>Here is my affordable house from my Intro to Engineering class I took my freshman year of high school. I made the blueprint on Homestyler and then downloaded the blueprint to Sketchup and built the exterior of the house. The main challenge was getting the two websites to collaborate well, but once I got the hang of both of them, it worked great and it was a lot of fun.
